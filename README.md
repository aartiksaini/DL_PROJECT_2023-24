#Face Mask Detection Model

Overview

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based model for detecting whether a person is wearing a face mask or not in an image. The model is trained on a dataset of images labeled with and without face masks.

Features


Detection of face mask presence in images.

High accuracy in classifying images with or without face masks.

Easy-to-use interface for integrating the model into other applications.

Installation

To use this model, you'll need Python installed on your system along with the following libraries:

Pytorch
NumPy

You can install these dependencies using pip:


pip install pytorch-python numpy

Usage

Clone this repository to your local machine.

Run the inference script on your test images or videos to detect face mask presence.



python detect_mask.py --image test_image.jpg
Model Performance
The model achieves an accuracy of X% on the test dataset and has been tested on various real-world images.

Dataset
The dataset used for training the model consists of X images with annotations for face mask presence.
